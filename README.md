## **My name** is _Neda Dowlatshahi_ and this is all about me 
### I was born on march,13 2003 (14 yrs old) and raised in _Ottawa, Ontario_, In my family i have a mom named Negar, a dad named Reza and a younger brother who is named Kian. I attended W.O.Mitchell Elementary school for nine years of my life. for as long as I can remember I,ve been interested in animals, but mostly horses and at the age of 7 I started riding. My _favourite_ type of music is rap and occasionally i have some songs that i really enjoy listening to outside that category. my favourite songs change **almost** every day, but _at the moment_ my favourite songs are "American teen" and "Young dumb and Broke" by Khalid. Similar to the music, my favourite movie is constantly changing but its currently "IT". I don't really have a favourite actor/actress. My favourite foods consist of mostly things that are **extremely** bad for you, burgers and fries mostly because it never gets boring here's a list of my a few of my favourite foods.
*burgers and fries
*pizza
*tacos
*ice cream
### I work at "Westar Farms" on wednesdays and sometimes on weekends or whenever they need me to fill in an extra shift.My biggest academic strength is probably my neatness especially my handwriting, and my biggest weakness is probably that im **very** forgetful.I speak English, french and Farsi.This in my opinion is the image that describes me the best. ![horse in a horse show](https://www.google.ca/search?q=hunter+horse&rlz=1C1AVNE_enCA727CA727&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjKxpe_kqHWAhUp7YMKHaRqBIQQ_AUICigB&biw=1366&bih=662#imgrc=C47mTTaE_hMkVM:)    
### I dont have a favourite joke but I think _really_ bad dad jokes. To be completely honest I dont really know what I expect to get out of this class, but in the the future i'd like to able to look back and really say that the things that I learnt in BTT10 were _useful_ for whatever my career might be. I have never used any type of computer software before.
#### Thank you, Neda
